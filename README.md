# idunno.Authentication

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/afcip59il6a7axo0?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/blowdart/idunno-authentication)

This repository contains a collection of various authentication mechanisms for ASP.NET Core, including

* [Basic Authentication](src/idunno.Authentication.Basic/)
* [Certificate Authentication](src/idunno.Authentication.Certificate/)

Basic Authentication started as a demonstration of how to write authentication middleware and was not
as something you would seriously consider using, but some people want Basic Authentication and
Certificate Authentication is a common request on the ASP.NET Core Security repo, so I am releasing my own versions of them.

All work is now targeted at ASP.NET Core 2.0.

This is **not** an official Microsoft project, this is an "In my spare time, entirely unsupported"™ effort.

## nuget packages

nuget packages are available for the ASP.NET Core 2.0 versions of the authentication handlers.

| Authentication Type | Package Name                      | nuget link                                                        | Current Version |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Basic               | idunno.Authentication.Basic       | https://www.nuget.org/packages/idunno.Authentication.Basic/       | 2.1.1           |
| Certificate         | idunno.Authentication.Certificate | https://www.nuget.org/packages/idunno.Authentication.Certificate/ | 2.1.1           |

## Version History

| Version | Notes |
|---------|-------|
|2.1.1    | Added [SourceLink](https://github.com/dotnet/sourcelink/blob/master/README.md)<br>Changed library dependencies to remove demands for exact versions, following the [.NET Core open-source library guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/library-guidance/)<br>nuget package is now signed
|2.1.0    | Added Certificate Authentication<br>Fixed Basic Authentication event handling<br>Packages are now Authenticode signed |


## What about older versions of ASP.NET Core?

Older versions of Basic Authentication are available in the appropriate branch. No nuget packages are available for ASP.NET Core 1.x.

Certificate Authentication is only available for ASP.NET Core 2.0. It will not be back ported to 1.x.

|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1.1                      | [rel/1.1.1](https://github.com/blowdart/idunno.Authentication/tree/rel/1.1.1) |
| 1.0                      | [rel/1.0.0](https://github.com/blowdart/idunno.Authentication/tree/rel/1.0.0) |

## Notes

Each handler requires you to authenticate the credentials passed.
You are responsible for hardening this authentication and ensuring it performs under load.
